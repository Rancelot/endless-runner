## Uniqueness 
- Knight Runner has very high quality visuals for a 2D platformer and its cartoon-like sprites make it a visually appealing game.
- It only has a single game mechanic to control the player that can make it a quick and fast game for anyone seeking such a thing.
- The sounds match the theme and environment the player is in. The background music adds an extra sense of suspense as the player goes through the forest.
- The scrolling parallax background at increasing speeds depending on the amount of coins the player has creates a sense of pressure towards the player.
- The random spawning system of either enemies, obstacles, or coins gives the player a sense of wariness to always pay attention so they do not lose or make frequent mistakes in their timing that could cost them lives.
